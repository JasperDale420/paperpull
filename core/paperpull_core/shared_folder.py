"""PaperPull Server's data folder, which other people may write.

On PaperPull Server every provider's folder lives in the data folder,
APPS_ROOT (/data), often a shared folder that other people on the network
can write to, and some shares let them leave a link there, a folder or a
file name that leads somewhere else. The container's user also owns
/config, where the server's password is kept, and /profiles, where every
signed-in browser profile is kept, so a write that followed a link out of
the data folder could land in either.

So on the server a run checks, where it writes, that the folder it writes
into is still inside the data folder once its links are followed, and a
write to a fixed or guessable name opens the file in a way that never
writes through a link left at that name. Off the server every function
here does exactly what the plain call it stands for does.
