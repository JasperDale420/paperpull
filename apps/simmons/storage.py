"""What makes the Simmons Bank app different, everything else is paperpull_core.

This file declares Simmons Bank's own facts: the folders it files into, how
a document routes to one, its CSV columns, and its config defaults. All the
storage logic itself lives in `paperpull_core`.

To repair Simmons Bank's *page* behavior, edit `simmons_site.py` instead.
